## Modpack concept: Slime Rancher esque pack,

A modpack based off of the hit game Slime Rancher, and centered around the mod Splendid Slimes by Chakyl! It will take place in a new dimension based off the Far, Far Range featuring 6(?) custom biomes, each with unique mechanics, resources, and slimes to collect. The gameplay loop involves exploring these areas to gather slimes and materials, bringing them back to your base, and using mods like Create and Botania to automate the feeding and plort collection of the slimes, progressing through these mods as you unlock new machines, slimes, and gadgets to assist you on your journey. Most of the resource generation will be through Splendid Slimes as you create different setups to accommodate for each slimes needs. There will also be a Plort Market with Slime ports being sold at variable prices, but we haven't really figured that part out yet.
